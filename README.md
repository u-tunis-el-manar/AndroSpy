An Android RAT that written in completely C# by me (qH0sT a.k.a Sagopa K)  

Yes, It is supporting dns connection like no-ip or duckdns or dynu......  

Your Visual Studio must have Xamarin Developing Kit, otherwise you can't build client. If you have Xamarin Kit then you must put path of some .exe in Settings window of AndroSpy and copy the all files of Client project to "ProjectFolder" path in SV project (\SV\bin\Debug\resources\ProjectFolder)

I'm very busy; I can't answer immediately for your issue.  

+How can I build a Client?

Don't worry, there is no complicated ``Socket`` programming; all thing is simple to understand.  

-You must also UDP port open; select item in comboBox on NAT page of Modem: TCP and UDP (both) , otherwise you can't hear live microphone.    

For Keylogger your victim must toggle on Accessibility button of your trojan in Settings of Device
